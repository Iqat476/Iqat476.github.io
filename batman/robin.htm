<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p class="text">Robin is the callsign given to Batman's kid sidekicks. The team of Batman and Robin is commonly referred to as the Dynamic Duo or the Caped Crusaders. Conceived as a vehicle to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman related comic books.[1] Dick Grayson appeared as the first Robin in 1940; after his becoming of Nightwing, several different youths have appeared as Robin.</p>

<div id="creation">
    <h1>Creation:</h1>
    <p class="text">The early adventures of Robin included Star Spangled Comics #65-130 (1947-1952), his first solo feature. The first Robin limited series was published in 1991, featuring Tim Drake's training to become the third Robin. Following two successful sequels, the monthly Robin ongoing series began in 1993 and was published until 2009. With Damian Wayne as the new Robin, a new series, entitled Red Robin, takes the place of the previous Robin series; it will follow Tim Drake in his new superhero role as he searches for Bruce Wayne.</p>
    <section class="text">About a year after Batman's debut, Batman creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger, along with inker/later ghost artist Jerry Robinson, introduced Robin the Boy Wonder in Detective Comics #38 (1940).</section><br>
    <section class="text">The name "Robin the Boy Wonder" and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by the Errol Flynn movie The Adventures of Robin Hood.[2] Later re-tellings of Robin's origin have instead often said the name comes from the robin bird, not Robin Hood.</section><br>
        
        <section class="text">Although Robin is best known as Batman's sidekick, three Robins have also been members of the superhero group the Teen Titans with the original Robin, Dick Grayson, being a founding member and the group's leader.</section><br>
</div>

<div class="alternate">
    <h1 class="header">Alternate Continuities:</h1>
    <h2 class="header" id="bruce">Bruce Wayne:</h2>
    <p class="text">A Batman story from the 1950s featured the young Bruce Wayne assuming the identity of Robin, complete with the original costume, in order to learn the basics of detective work from a famous detective named Harvey Harris. This story was later revised in the 1980s to edit out any reference to Bruce Wayne having ever called himself "Robin" or worn any costume before he finally donned his Batman costume as an adult. John Byrne later worked this aspect into his non-canonical story Superman & Batman: Generations.</p>
    <section class="text">Post-Crisis, there was one instance in continuity when Bruce Wayne adopted the Robin persona. In Batboy & Robin, a tie-in special to the DC Comics storyline Sins of Youth, Bruce and Tim Drake, the third Robin, had their ages magically switched. In an effort to keep up the illusion of Batman, Bruce had Tim adopt the Batman identity while he is forced to be Robin.</section>

    <section id="lance">
    <h2 class="header">Lance Bruner:</h2>
    <p class="text">He was adopted by Bruce after his father died in an accident. He will pick up Robin's mask to help Batman defeat Grantland Stark, a thief who stole millions of dollars in oil, but will die sacrificing himself for Batman.</p>
    </section>

    <div id="earth-two-grayson">
        <h2>Earth-Two Dick Grayson:</h2>
        <p class="text">On Earth-Two, home of the Golden Age version of DC's superheroes, Grayson continued to be Robin even as adult, having no successors, and even after Batman's death. His allies included the All-Star Squadron along with Batwoman and Flamebird. He eventually became a member of the Justice Society of America.</p>

        <section class="text">During his later years, he adopted a more Batman-like look for a time, and by the 1960s had become a lawyer and the ambassador to South Africa. Although in semi-retirement, he was called back to active duty when he rejoined the Justice Society during the period when Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid also assisted them.</section><br>
            
        <section class="text">He died during the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, in which the DC Multiverse was reduced to one universe, and this version of Grayson, as well as the Earth-Two Batman, were deemed never to have existed.</section><br>
